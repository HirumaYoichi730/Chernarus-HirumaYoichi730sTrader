DayZ Chernarus - HirumaYoichi730sTrader
I had this idea for a Trader at Radio Zenit. And it´s up to 1.18 items.

This has been tested on Xbox One. And hopefully this should work on PC and on PS as well.
However, if there is some errors or bugs with this file. Please feel free to email to 
hirumayoichi730@gmail.com with some screenshots.

So, this is a trader with two Land_City_Store buildings on top of each other that I made and 
it is located at Radio Zenit next to the truckspawn.
It contains basically every kind of clothing and all kind of bags in the game on the first floor.
Also it contains food, drinks, meat, fish, chickens and a rabbit and they are in the freezers.
There are two of each of the cans of food and drinks.
On the Second floor there is 32 wooden logs, 64 barbed wire, 16 camonets, 8 cartents and largetents, 
there are 4 of each color of mediumtents and partytents.
There is also tools for building a base, 10 construction lights, 5 power generators with 5 spark plugs on a table nearby. There is
also 5 xmas lights on that table.
The store is using 16 pumkinhelmets as lights so that people won´t be needing to use any kind of light to see in the store.

How to install this file to your server:
Go to your Custom folder for your server, upload the file.
Then go to your cfggameplay.json file, go to "objectSpawnersArr": [ and type in "./custom/HirumaYoichi730sTrader.json"
and if you have more custom files then add an , after ...json" like this -> "./custom/HirumaYoichi730sTrader.json", "./custom/anotherfile.json" .
After that just save the changes and then restart the server and if all is done right then your server has a new base area.

Thank you for reading this text.
I hope you like this store.
